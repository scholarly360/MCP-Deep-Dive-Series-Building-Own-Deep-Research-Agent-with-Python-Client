I encountered an error while trying to access the Honda page; it seems like the connection was aborted. However, I successfully accessed the Nissan page about the termination of the MOU between Nissan and Honda. Here are the key points from the Nissan article:

1. **Termination Agreement**: Nissan and Honda have decided to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) they signed for a business integration. This decision was made on February 13, 2025.

2. **Discussion Details**: Both companies engaged in discussions involving their management teams and considered various market conditions, business objectives, and strategies.

3. **Proposed Business Structures**: Honda initially suggested a joint holding company but later proposed a structure where Honda would be the parent company through a share exchange with Nissan as a subsidiary.

4. **Reason for Termination**: The companies concluded it was better to cease discussions to prioritize decision-making speed and management execution in the rapidly evolving automotive market, especially in the context of electrification.

5. **Future Collaboration**: Despite terminating the MOU, Nissan and Honda plan to collaborate strategically in the future, focusing on creating value in the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles.

The other Honda article could not be accessed, hence only information from Nissan's perspective is provided here.
